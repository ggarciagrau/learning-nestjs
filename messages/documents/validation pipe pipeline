1. class-transforme transforms the plain body object to a instance of the dto class object
2. class-validator runs the validations before entering the controller function
3. If there are unfullfilled validations, class-validator will throw an error and nestjs exception handler will return as the response

*Type information is preserved on transpilation thanks to the decorators, you can inspect the contorller file in the dist folder. (emitDecoratorMetadata, experimentalDecorators).
